# Cirkl Labs

We are a security research company, our website is [cirkl.ai](https://cirkl.ai)

We care a *lot* about privacy, so we are creating an antivirus that doesn't spy on you
or give you annoying popups.

And we're creating a web browser that doesn't treat you like a product
while keeping you safe from malware and trackers.

## Nerdy stuff
Our favorite languages (in no specific order):
- **C++**-Really fun, and it's quite splendid for low-level code, also multithreadding is easy peasy compared to C
- **Zig**-Fun to learn, good for high-performance and low level control with enhanced safety
- **Kotlin**-Really, REALLY nice with the [Ktor](https://ktor.io) framework, it makes API insanely easy (also mobile apps with KMP)
- **JS**-Absolutely terrible but also amazing
- **TS**-JS but with types ;) (still a pain)
- **Dart**-Really nice, performant and simple language with a familiar syntax and easy to make APIs in and software in general.

Our favorite technologies
- **Anything from [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com)**-IntelliJ has saved my brain, CLion saved my legs
- **macOS**-Beautiful UI, amazing stability (update: macOS 26 is horribly buggy and also really nice)
- **Linux**-Amazing on the server, amazing on the Desktop

## [Thoq's](https://thoq-jar.github.io) Rant

Things I hate with a burning passion:
- **VSCode**-Electron is slow and VSCode is no exception, it's massive on a drive and in memory
- **Electron**-people dont know how to properly optimize it, I hate electron apps but not Electron itself (usually)
- **People who say C++ is unsafe and Rust is better**-I like both, please just leave it at both are good, both have up's and down's!
- **GTK (On windows)**-GTK looks pretty, it's a shame it's an **ABSOLUTE PAIN** to get working on Windows! Oh, speaking of...
- **Windows**—Terrible os, AI infested + most games do work on linux, thanks to valve! It also doesn't even look that good and
its super buggy; I have no idea how people survive on Windows.
- **Me**-I create Most of the problems I encounter.
- **Oracle**-Breh, release the JS trademark already ([Deno v. Oracle](https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle))

Things I love with the power of a thousand suns:
- **Gleam**-I have never learned a language so quickly
- **Elixir**-Simply amazing, never before have I enjoyed creating a web app.
- **Rust**-The G.O.A.T

> Note: The not all of the above languages in this section are in use at Cirkl, I just personaly like them ;)
