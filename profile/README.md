# Cirkl Labs

We are a security research company, our website is [cirkl.ai](https://cirkl.ai)

We care a *lot* about privacy, so we are creating an antivirus that doesn't spy on you
or give you annoying popups.

And we're creating a web browser that doesn't treat you like a product
while keeping you safe from malware and trackers.

## [Thoq's](https://thoq-jar.github.io) Rant

Things I hate with a burning passion:
- **VSCode**-Electron is slow and VSCode is no exception, it's massive on a drive and in memory
- **Electron**-people dont know how to properly optimize it, I hate electron apps but not Electron itself (usually)
- **People who say C++ is unsafe and Rust is better**-I like both, please just leave it at both are good, both have up's and down's!
- **GTK (On windows)**-GTK looks pretty, it's a shame it's an **ABSOLUTE PAIN** to get working on Windows! Oh, speaking of...
- **Windows**â€”Terrible os, AI infested + most games do work on linux, thanks to valve! It also doesn't even look that good and
its super buggy; I have no idea how people survive on Windows.
- **Me**-I create Most of the problems I encounter.
- **Oracle**-Breh, release the JS trademark already ([Deno v. Oracle](https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle))

Things I love with the power of a thousand suns:
- **Gleam**-I have never learned a language so quickly
- **Elixir**-Simply amazing, never before have I enjoyed creating a web app.
- **Rust**-The G.O.A.T

> Note: The not all of the above languages in this section are in use at Cirkl, I just personaly like them ;)
