# Cirkl Labs

We are a security research company, our website is [cirkl.ai](https://cirkl.ai)

We care a *lot* about privacy, so we are creating an antivirus that doesn't spy on you
or give you annoying popups.

And we're creating a web browser that doesn't treat you like a product
while keeping you safe from malware and trackers.

## Nerdy stuff
Our favorite languages (in no specific order):
- **C++**-It's fast and not a pain in the donkey
- **Java**-It's Robust, and Spring boot is pretty dang nice, oh, it's also great for prototyping
- **Rust**-Really fun, and it's quite splendid for network facing software
- **JS**-Absolutely terrible but also amazing

Our favorite technologies
- **QT**-Its really nice and amazing for cross-platform UI development
- **JQuery**-Simple, concise and really easy to work with, at this point it should be a part of ECMAScript
- **ThreeJS**-Really cool, allows for fun effects in browser
- **Anything from [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com)**-IntelliJ is awesome, CLion has saved my legs.
- **macOS**-Beautiful UI, amazing stability
- **Linux**-Amazing on the server, amazing on the Desktop (i use arch btw)
- **Deno**-While not used in frontend as we use Spring there, it is used to create CLI's for automation and it's amazing

## Rant

Things I hate with a burning passion:
- **VSCode**-Electron is slow and VSCode is no exception, it's massive on a drive and in memory
- **Electron**-no
- **People who say C++ is unsafe and Rust is better**-I like both, please just leave it at both are good, both have up's and down's!
- **GTK (On windows)**-GTK looks pretty, it's a shame it's an **ABSOLUTE PAIN** to get working on Windows! Oh, speaking of...
- **Windows**â€”Terrible os, AI infested + most games do work on linux, thanks to valve! It also doesn't even look that good and
its super buggy; I have no idea how people survive on Windows.
- **Me**-I create Most of the problems I encounter.
- **Oracle**-Breh, release the JS trademark already ([Deno v. Oracle](https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle))

Things I love with the power of a thousand suns:
- **Gleam**-I have never learned a language so quickly
- **Elixir**-Simply amazing, never before have I enjoyed creating a web app.
    -Note: The none of the above languages in this section are in use at Cirkl, I just personaly like them ;)
